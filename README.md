# Takk-FTP-Chat
A simple command-prompt based chat online written in batch
## Notes
You must have your FTP access credentials to chat. Here are some notes of what you have to complete:
> FTP-HOST: Here put the host to connect (e.g. ftp.goole.com)(don't use that because it doesn't exist)
>
> FTP-USER: Here write your ftp account user
>
> FTP-PASSWORD: Here write your ftp account password
>
> FTP-CUSTOM-CD': Here you can choose a specific location in your ftp host
>
> Note: Some FTP hosts, like InfiniteFree web hosting, don't allow you to put files direct on the main directory, so write a valid directory (e.g. in the case of InfiniteFree web hosting, you must place your files in the folder called 'htdocs', so in 'ftp-custom-cd.txt' write 'htdocs')
